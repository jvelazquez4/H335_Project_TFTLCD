# This is our edited version of the Adafruit library for 8-bit TFT LCDs such as ILI9325, ILI9328, etc

This now includes functionality for the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. Some things to be noted:

  * The examples included in this library will not be functional as they are currently. Please edit them according to the 
    notes in the Main READ.ME File as well as according to the examples in MAIN.

This is a library for our Adafruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver, shield or FeatherWing
